              <p class="team-name">CEO/Founder: CATHERINE OGIE- LUCAS</p>
              <p> As a young girl in Nigeria, Catherine Ogie- Lucas was shy but very smart.  She watched as her mother ran a small business out of their home which provided essential provision for their family.   “When I think back to my childhood, I remember the way my mother always provided for us.  I know that is where I developed my entrepreneurial desires.  I grew up as a strong Christian and my faith remains a strong part of my life today.  Back then, I truly felt that I was being led toward starting a small business, but it took me a lot of research and exploration to figure out exactly what that meant.” Cathy started her career at the age of 19 in an entry level position at a law firm in her homeland.  She quickly rose to the position of Office Manager due to her natural skills in customer service.  As she progressed professionally, her dreams began to grow and she knew she had to move to America to further her education. She received her undergraduate degree in Psychology from UT-Dallas and immediately started herMBA at the same university.  Her on-the- job experience had trained her in working with the customer and her Masters education had given her the fundamentals of running a business.  Knowing that she wanted to provide people with practical solutions and a sense of peace, she created Rockhaven which provides life coaching along with traditional staffing services and also established a non-profit whose mission is to bring hope to the hopeless.</p>
              <p class="p2">Cathy’s foundation beliefs for Rockhaven is that a strong coaching relationship promotes self-discovery and positive change.  She empowers her clients to “soar above life’s difficulties” to find their true identity, purpose and destiny.  Her coaching style enables her clients to open their hearts to greater love, joy and fulfillment.  As a Christian coach, she believes in the awesome power God can release when two or more meet in the name of Jesus. In addition to more than 15 years of counseling and coaching experience, she has been designated as a Qualified Mental Health Professional (QHMP) and has been certified through the  International Christian Coach Association Program (ICCA) and the American Association of Christian Counselors (AACC).  Today, Cathy specializes in coaching Ministry Leaders, Women and Teens.  She facilitates curriculum based programs at Detention Centers, Recreation Centers, DISD, GISD and CFBISD schools in the Dallas Metroplex.  Her training topics include Community Building, Conflict Resolution, Premarital issues, Bullying, Cyber Bullying, Parenting, Time Management, Stress Reduction and Relationships. Her passion for helping people keeps her looking for new ways to expand and better service those with whom she works,  giving her business a cutting edge as she helps her clients, whether company or individual, transverse major life transitions.</p>
