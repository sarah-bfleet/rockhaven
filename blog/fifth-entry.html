            <h1>Journey of a refugee </h1>
            <img src="../img/new-pics/blog4.jpg" alt="">
            <h2>Who is a Refugee?</h2>
            <p>According to the 1951 Convention, the key legal document that defines who a refugee is.  Article 1 of this document defines a refugee as someone who has fled his or her country “owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.”
            </p>
            <p>There are currently some 43 million uprooted victims of conflict and persecution worldwide. More than 15 million of them are refugees who have fled their countries, while another 27 million are people who remain displaced by conflict inside their own homelands -- so-called “internally displaced people”.
            </p>
            <p>The Refugees that we serve all face loss of their home, their livelihood, their community. Regardless of whether they have crossed a border or not, they deserve help. And with internally displaced people today outnumbering refugees by nearly two to one, the needs are greater than ever.
            </p>
            <h3>Resettlement</h3>
            <p>Refugee is sent to a third country to be resettled. Less than 1% of refugees are given this option.</p>

            </h4>
            <p class="bold">US DEPARTMENT OF STATE MIGRATION PROCESSING</p>
            <p>Refugee is interviewed by US Department of Homeland Security officials to determine if he or she is eligible for resettlement. Once he or she is approved, the resettlement and placement process begins:
